# Heather Nuffer--@ethyl2

👋 Hi, I'm Heather.

👩 I am a web developer who fuses a background in science 🧪 and the arts 🎨, with attention to detail and design, to deliver quality websites and applications.

🧠 I love learning about new technologies and enjoy teaching others what I learn. I'm known for a strong work ethic, dependability, and effective team collaboration. I am excited to keep progressing in my career and look forward to opportunities which will allow me to improve my skills.

🍳 Creating things is my passion. When I'm not coding web applications, you can find me making something with fabric, music, paint, or pen -- or trying out a new vegetarian/vegan recipe in my kitchen.

🎓 I graduated from the full-stack web development program at Lambda School. I also have a BS in microbiology from Brigham Young University.
